	To start off with my classes I started off with node which is the 
backbone of my program. This class contains an array of nodes that is used 
to create the digit tree. Class DigitTree is used to make the Digit tree and
allow users to interact using the methods given in the assignment. The test 
class then makes a menu and lets users navigate to interact with the different 
digit trees. Run simply runs test which runs DigitTree which uses node to make 
a digit tree. DigitFormatException is an custom error that is triggered whenever 
a user tries to input a non numeric String into the tree. 

	One of my main things I tried to do when creating this program was to 
capitalize on the strengths of digit trees when working with strings. I felt
 that overall I did a good job in that even though there might be a few instances
 where I didn't use the digit tree to its full potential. This mainly had to do 
with the intersect, contains, and subtract methods. I felt like I was fairly
 efficient with those methods where other data structures like ArrayLists or
 linkedLists might have been less efficient.
